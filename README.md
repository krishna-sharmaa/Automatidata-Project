# Automatidata - New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Project
This repository contains work on a data analytics project as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

**Project Overview**
Automatidata, a data consulting firm, is partnering with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to develop a regression model that estimates taxi fares before rides. The TLC dataset includes information from over 200,000 licensed taxi and limousine drivers, generating around 1 million trips daily.

**The project aims to:**

Analyze the TLC data to uncover trends and insights.
Build a predictive model to estimate taxi fares based on historical trip data.
The dataset and project tasks will involve cleaning data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and developing a machine learning model to achieve the project's goals.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Data analysis and modeling
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Building the regression model
